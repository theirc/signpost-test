*Display - Worker Configuration Interface*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Display Worker is a simple yet powerful debugging tool that allows you to display any input data for testing purposes. It is a part of the Signpost AI Worker framework and is primarily used for debugging and testing. It takes an input and directly outputs it without any modifications.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The Display Worker is initialized with the following parameters:

- `type`: The type of worker, which is "display" for the Display Worker.
- `direction`: The direction of the data flow, which can be either "input" or "output".
- `title`: The title of the data flow, which can be either "Input" or "Output".
- `name`: The name of the data flow, which can be either "input" or "output".

## 3. Input/Output Handles

The Display Worker has two handles:

- `input`: The input handle takes in any data that you want to display.
- `output`: The output handle shows the same data that was inputted.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

Here is a simple example of how to use the Display Worker:

```typescript
const worker = agent.initializeWorker(
  { type: "display" },
  [
    { type: "unknown", direction: "input", title: "Input", name: "input" },
    { type: "unknown", direction: "output", title: "Output", name: "output" },
  ],
  display
)

worker.fields.input.value = "Hello, World!"
await worker.execute()
console.log(worker.fields.output.value) // "Hello, World!"
```

## 5. Integration Examples

The Display Worker can be integrated into any part of your data pipeline for debugging purposes. For example, you can use it to check the output of a previous worker:

```typescript
const previousWorker = ...
previousWorker.fields.output.connect(display.fields.input)
await display.execute()
console.log(display.fields.output.value) // output of previousWorker
```

## 6. Best Practices

- Use the Display Worker sparingly in production code. It is primarily a debugging tool.
- Always disconnect the Display Worker from the data pipeline when you're done with it to prevent unnecessary data flow.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the Display Worker is not showing any output, make sure that it is properly connected to the data pipeline.
- If the output is not what you expected, check the output of the previous workers in the pipeline.
