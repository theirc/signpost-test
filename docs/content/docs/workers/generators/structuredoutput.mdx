*Structured Output Worker Interface - Configure AI response formatting*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Schema Worker is designed to validate and translate JSON data based on a defined schema. It uses the Zod library to create and validate schemas, and the Typechat library to translate JSON data. The worker is highly flexible and can handle a variety of data types, including booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and enums.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The Schema Worker accepts the following configuration parameters:

- `model`: (Optional) The language model to use for translation. The default model is "gpt-4o".

## 3. Input/Output Handles

The Schema Worker has two handles:

- `input`: (Input) The input data to be validated and translated.
- `json`: (Output) The validated and translated JSON data.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

Here is an example of how to use the Schema Worker:

```javascript
const worker = create(agent);
worker.fields.input.value = { "key": "value" };
await worker.execute();
console.log(worker.fields.json.value); // Outputs the validated and translated JSON data
```

## 5. Integration Examples

The Schema Worker can be integrated into a larger system to handle data validation and translation. For example, it could be used in a data pipeline to validate incoming data and translate it into a standardized format.

```javascript
const pipeline = [worker1, worker2, create(agent)];
pipeline.forEach(worker => {
  worker.fields.input.value = getData();
  await worker.execute();
  passData(worker.fields.json.value);
});
```

## 6. Best Practices

- Always provide a valid schema for the data you expect to handle. This will ensure that the data is correctly validated and translated.
- Handle the case where the input data is null or undefined. The Schema Worker will not execute if the input data is null or undefined.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the Schema Worker is not executing, check that the input data is not null or undefined.
- If the output data is not as expected, check that the schema matches the structure of the input data.
- If you are getting a validation error, check that the input data matches the schema.
