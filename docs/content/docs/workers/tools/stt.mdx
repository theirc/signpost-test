*Stt - Worker Configuration Interface*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Stt Worker is a tool that uses OpenAI's Whisper engine to convert speech to text. It is designed to take an audio file as input and produce a textual transcription as output. This worker is useful in a variety of applications, from transcription services to voice command interpretation.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The Stt Worker has the following configuration parameters:

- `engine`: This optional parameter specifies the engine to be used for the speech-to-text conversion. The default value is "whisper-1".

## 3. Input/Output Handles

The Stt Worker has the following input and output handles:

- `input`: This is the input handle where the audio file to be transcribed is passed. The audio file should be in the format `{ audio: string, ext: string }`.

- `output`: This is the output handle where the textual transcription of the audio file is returned.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

Here is an example of how to use the Stt Worker:

```javascript
const worker = agent.initializeWorker(
  {
    type: "stt",
    conditionable: true,
  },
  [
    { type: "audio", direction: "input", title: "Input", name: "input" },
    { type: "string", direction: "output", title: "Output", name: "output" },
  ],
  stt
) as STTWorker;

worker.fields.input.value = { audio: "base64 encoded audio", ext: "mp3" };
await worker.execute();
console.log(worker.fields.output.value); // Outputs the transcription of the audio
```

## 5. Integration Examples

The Stt Worker can be integrated into a variety of applications. For example, it can be used in a voice command system to convert spoken commands into text that can be processed by the system. It can also be used in a transcription service to convert audio recordings into written text.

## 6. Best Practices

- Ensure that the audio file passed to the `input` handle is in a format that the Whisper engine can process.
- Handle the output carefully as it is the transcription of the audio and may contain sensitive information.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the worker is not producing the expected output, ensure that the audio file is correctly formatted and that the Whisper engine is able to process it.
- If the worker is not executing, ensure that the OpenAI API key is correctly configured.
