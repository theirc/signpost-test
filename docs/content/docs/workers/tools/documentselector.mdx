*Documentselector - Worker Configuration Interface*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Documentselector Worker is an AI worker that uses a language model to select and prioritize relevant documents from a given set of documents based on a provided question and context. This worker is especially useful in applications where there is a need to filter and prioritize information from a large set of documents.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The worker has the following configuration parameters:

- `results`: An optional parameter that specifies the number of results to return. If not provided, the default value is 8.

## 3. Input/Output Handles

The worker has the following input/output fields:

- `input`: The input question that will be used to search the documents.
- `output`: The output field where the search results will be stored.
- `prompt`: An optional prompt that can be used to guide the search.
- `documents`: The documents that will be searched.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

Here is an example of how to use the Documentselector Worker:

```javascript
const worker = new DocumentSelectorWorker();
worker.fields.input.value = "What is the capital of France?";
worker.fields.documents.value = [
  {title: "France", body: "The capital of France is Paris."},
  {title: "Germany", body: "The capital of Germany is Berlin."},
  // More documents...
];
worker.parameters.results = 5;
await worker.execute();
console.log(worker.fields.output.value);
```

In this example, the worker will search the documents for the answer to the question "What is the capital of France?" and store the results in the output field.

## 5. Integration Examples

The Documentselector Worker can be integrated into any application that needs to filter and prioritize information from a large set of documents. For example, it can be used in a chatbot application to provide relevant answers to user questions based on a set of pre-defined documents.

## 6. Best Practices

- Ensure that the input question is clear and specific.
- Provide a prompt if possible to guide the search.
- Ensure that the documents are well-structured and contain relevant information.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the worker is not returning any results, check that the input question and documents are correctly set.
- If the worker is returning too many or too few results, adjust the `results` parameter.
- If the worker is not prioritizing the documents correctly, check the prompt and the structure of the documents.
