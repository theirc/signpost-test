*Search - Worker Configuration Interface*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Search Worker is a crucial part of the Signpost AI system. It is responsible for generating an embedding vector for a given text string using the OpenAI API. This is essential for the system's ability to understand and process text data in an efficient and meaningful way.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The worker requires the OpenAI API key as a configuration parameter. The API key is used to authenticate the requests made to the OpenAI API.

## 3. Input/Output Handles

- Input: A text string for which an embedding vector is to be generated.
- Output: An embedding vector for the given text string, or an error message if the operation fails.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

```javascript
const text = "This is a sample text";
const apiKeys = { openai: "your_openai_api_key" };

generateEmbedding(text, apiKeys).then((result) => {
  if (result.error) {
    console.error("Error generating embedding:", result.error);
  } else {
    console.log("Generated embedding:", result.data);
  }
});
```

## 5. Integration Examples

The Search Worker can be integrated into any system where text data needs to be processed and understood. For example, it can be used in a chatbot system to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.

## 6. Best Practices

- Always ensure that the OpenAI API key is correctly set in the environment variables.
- Handle the error messages appropriately to understand what went wrong in case of a failure.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the worker fails with a message about a missing OpenAI API key, ensure that the key is correctly set in the environment variables.
- If the worker fails with an HTTP error, check the status code and the status text for more information about the error.
- If the worker fails with a message about an invalid response structure from the OpenAI API, it might be due to changes in the API. Check the OpenAI API documentation for any changes.
