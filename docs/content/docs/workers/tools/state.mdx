*State - Worker Configuration Interface*




## 1. Overview and Purpose

The State Worker is a tool that allows you to persist data for later use. It is designed to store the state of a process, enabling you to retrieve and use the stored data at a later point in the execution flow. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain the state of a process across different stages of execution.

## 2. Configuration Parameters

The State Worker does not require any specific configuration parameters. It uses the default configuration provided by the AIWorker interface.

## 3. Input/Output Handles

The State Worker has two handles:

- `input`: This is where the data to be persisted is provided. The data provided here will be stored and can be retrieved later.

- `output`: This is where the persisted data is retrieved from. The data stored from the `input` handle can be accessed here.

## 4. Usage Examples with Code

Here is a basic example of how to use the State Worker:

```javascript
const worker = agent.initializeWorker(
  { type: "state" },
  [
    { type: "unknown", direction: "input", title: "Input", name: "input", system: true },
    { type: "unknown", direction: "output", title: "Output", name: "output", system: true },
  ],
  state
) as StateWorker

// Persist data
worker.fields.input.value = "Some data to persist"

// Retrieve persisted data
const persistedData = worker.fields.output.value
```

## 5. Integration Examples

The State Worker can be integrated with other workers in a workflow. For example, you can use the State Worker to store the result of a computation performed by another worker, and then retrieve this result in a subsequent worker for further processing.

## 6. Best Practices

- Always check if the `input` value is not null before attempting to persist it. This ensures that you do not overwrite previously stored data with null values.

- Use meaningful names for your State Workers, especially when you have multiple State Workers in a workflow. This makes it easier to identify which worker is responsible for storing which data.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- If you are not able to retrieve the data you stored, ensure that you are accessing the correct `output` handle.

- If the `output` value is not what you expected, check the `input` value to ensure that the correct data was provided for persistence.
