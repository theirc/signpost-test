# Agentic AI in Signpost AI

Signpost AI is built around the power of agentic AI - intelligent systems that can autonomously reason, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to prompts, agentic AI can plan, execute multi-step workflows, and adapt its behavior based on context and outcomes. This guide explains how agentic AI works in Signpost AI and how you can harness its capabilities.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals, make decisions, and execute complex workflows without constant human intervention. In Signpost AI, we use **intelligent agents** that can understand context, reason through problems, and coordinate multiple actions to help users effectively.

## How Agentic AI Works in Signpost AI

### 1. **AI Agent Architecture**

The core of agentic AI in Signpost AI is the **intelligent agent** - an autonomous system that can understand goals, plan actions, and execute workflows.

```javascript
// Example Agent Configuration
{
  "agent_type": "humanitarian_assistant",
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "goals": ["Help users access services", "Provide accurate information", "Escalate when needed"],
  "capabilities": ["document_search", "service_lookup", "appointment_booking"],
  "decision_framework": "Always prioritize user safety and dignity",
  "escalation_rules": "Transfer to human for medical emergencies or legal issues"
}
```

### 2. **Autonomous Workflow Execution**

When a user interacts with an agent, the agentic AI system:

1. **Analyzes the request** and identifies the user's underlying goals
2. **Plans a workflow** to achieve those goals effectively
3. **Executes actions** such as searching knowledge bases, booking appointments, or gathering information
4. **Monitors progress** and adapts the plan if needed
5. **Delivers results** and follows up to ensure user satisfaction

### 3. **Intelligent Decision Making**

Agentic AI agents can make autonomous decisions by:

1. **Evaluating options** based on available information and context
2. **Considering consequences** of different actions
3. **Applying ethical frameworks** and organizational policies
4. **Choosing optimal paths** to achieve user goals
5. **Learning from outcomes** to improve future decisions

### 4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**

Complex workflows can involve multiple specialized agents:

1. **Intake Agent**: Understands user needs and routes requests
2. **Information Agent**: Searches knowledge bases and provides answers
3. **Service Agent**: Books appointments and coordinates services
4. **Escalation Agent**: Handles complex cases requiring human intervention
