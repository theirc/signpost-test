# Generative AI in Signpost AI

Signpost AI is built around the power of generative AI - the technology that enables computers to create human-like text, understand context, and generate intelligent responses. This guide explains how generative AI works in Signpost AI and how you can harness its capabilities.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content - text, images, audio, or other media - based on patterns they've learned from vast amounts of training data. In Signpost AI, we primarily use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for text generation and understanding.

### Key Capabilities in Signpost AI

- **Text Generation**: Create human-like responses and content
- **Context Understanding**: Process and understand conversation history
- **Document Analysis**: Extract insights from uploaded documents
- **Multi-modal Processing**: Handle text, images, and audio

## How Generative AI Works in Signpost AI

### 1. **AI Worker Component**

The core of generative AI in Signpost AI is the **AI Worker** - a building block that connects to any of the supported AI models.

```javascript
// Example AI Worker Configuration
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "prompt": "You are a helpful customer service assistant...",
  "input": "User's question or request",
  "documents": "Relevant context from knowledge base",
  "history": "Previous conversation context"
}
```

### 2. **Input Processing**

When a user sends a message, Signpost AI:

1. **Receives the input** through various channels (web chat, WhatsApp, API)
2. **Enriches with context** from your knowledge base
3. **Adds conversation history** for continuity
4. **Formats the prompt** with system instructions

### 3. **AI Model Processing**

The AI model then:

1. **Analyzes the input** and context
2. **Generates a response** based on its training
3. **Considers conversation history** for consistency
4. **Applies your instructions** and personality

### 4. **Output Generation**

Finally, Signpost AI:

1. **Formats the response** according to your specifications
2. **Sends it back** through the appropriate channel
3. **Stores the interaction** for future reference
4. **Updates conversation history** for continuity

## Key Features of Generative AI in Signpost AI

### üéØ **Context-Aware Responses**

Your AI agents remember conversation history and can reference previous interactions:

```
User: "What emergency services are available?"
Agent: "Based on our current information, we have medical teams, food distribution, and shelter services available in your area."

User: "Can you remind me what we discussed earlier?"
Agent: "Earlier you asked about emergency services. I mentioned we have medical teams, food distribution, and shelter services available in your area."
```

### üìö **Knowledge Base Integration**

AI agents can access and reference your uploaded documents:

```
User: "What health services are available at the clinic?"
Agent: "Based on our clinic information document, we provide vaccinations, basic medical care, maternal health services, and emergency treatment. The clinic is open Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 6 PM..."
```

### üîß **Structured Output**

Generate formatted responses like JSON, tables, or specific formats:

```json
{
  "response": "Here's your assistance request summary",
  "request": {
    "id": "AID-12345",
    "status": "registered",
    "services": ["Medical Care", "Food Assistance", "Shelter"],
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

### üé® **Customizable Personality**

Define how your AI agent behaves and responds:

```
System Prompt: "You are a compassionate, professional humanitarian aid worker.
Always be helpful, patient, and culturally sensitive. Use a warm, supportive tone
and prioritize the safety and dignity of those you're assisting."
```
