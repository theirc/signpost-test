# Understanding Workers: The Building Blocks of Your AI Agent

Think of **workers** as the specialized tools in your AI agent's toolkit. Each worker has a specific job, and together they make your agent capable of handling complex tasks intelligently.

## What Are Workers?

Workers are pre-built components that give your AI agent specific abilities. Instead of building everything from scratch, you can mix and match workers to create exactly the AI assistant you need.

### The Toolbox Analogy

Imagine you're building a house. You don't need to invent hammers, saws, and drills - you use the right tool for each job. Workers are like those tools:

- **AI Worker** = Your master craftsman (can think, reason, and create)
- **Search Worker** = Your research assistant (finds specific information)
- **Document Generator** = Your secretary (creates formatted documents)
- **Message Worker** = Your communications specialist (sends messages to users)

## Core Workers: The Essential Tools

### AI Worker - The Brain

**What it does:** This is your agent's intelligence. It can understand complex questions, think through problems, and generate helpful responses.

**When to use it:**

- Complex conversations that require reasoning
- Creative tasks like writing content
- Situations where context and nuance matter
- When you need natural, conversational responses

**Real-world example:**

```
User: "I'm worried about my child's vaccination schedule because we missed some appointments due to the pandemic"

AI Worker Response: "I understand your concern about missed vaccinations during the pandemic. This is very common, and it's great that you're thinking about getting back on track. Let me help you understand what vaccines your child might need and how to safely catch up..."
```

### Search Worker - The Researcher

**What it does:** Quickly finds specific information from your knowledge base or documents.

**When to use it:**

- Factual questions that need precise answers
- Looking up specific information (dates, numbers, procedures)
- High-volume queries where speed matters
- When you need consistent, reliable information

**Real-world example:**

```
User: "What are the clinic hours on Saturdays?"

Search Worker Response: "Our clinic is open Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. We offer vaccinations, basic health screenings, and emergency care during these hours."
```

### Document Generator - The Writer

**What it does:** Creates structured documents, reports, or formatted content based on information.

**When to use it:**

- Generating reports or summaries
- Creating formatted documents (letters, certificates, forms)
- When you need consistent document structure
- Producing multiple documents with the same format

**Real-world example:**

```
User: "I need a letter confirming my child's vaccination record"

Document Generator Response: Creates a properly formatted letter with clinic letterhead, vaccination dates, and professional formatting.
```

### Message Worker - The Communicator

**What it does:** Sends messages to users through different channels (SMS, WhatsApp, email).

**When to use it:**

- Sending responses to users
- Delivering notifications or reminders
- Following up with users after conversations
- Broadcasting important information

**Real-world example:**

```
Message Worker sends: "Hi Maria, this is a reminder that your child's next vaccination is due on March 15th. Please call us to schedule an appointment."
```

## Specialized Workers: Advanced Tools

### Combine Worker - The Coordinator

**What it does:** Takes information from multiple sources and combines them into a single, coherent response.

**When to use it:**

- When you need information from different databases
- Combining search results with AI-generated explanations
- Creating comprehensive responses from multiple sources

**Real-world example:**

```
User: "What services do you offer for pregnant women?"

Combine Worker: Pulls information from health services database, adds clinic schedule information, and combines with AI-generated explanation of prenatal care importance.
```

### Selector Worker - The Decision Maker

**What it does:** Chooses the best response or action based on certain conditions or criteria.

**When to use it:**

- Routing users to different services based on their needs
- Choosing different responses based on user characteristics
- Implementing business rules and logic

**Real-world example:**

```
Selector Worker: "If user is pregnant → provide prenatal care information. If user has emergency → escalate to human staff. If user needs routine care → provide appointment booking information."
```

### Persist Worker - The Memory Keeper

**What it does:** Saves important information from conversations for future use.

**When to use it:**

- Remembering user preferences
- Tracking conversation history
- Storing important data for follow-up
- Building user profiles over time

**Real-world example:**

```
Persist Worker saves: "User Maria prefers Spanish language, has a 2-year-old child, and last visited on February 10th for vaccination."
```

## How Workers Work Together

### The Orchestra Analogy

Think of workers like musicians in an orchestra. Each has their specialty, but together they create beautiful music:

**Scenario: A parent asks about their child's health**

1. **Search Worker** finds the child's medical records
2. **AI Worker** interprets the information and generates a caring response
3. **Document Generator** creates a health summary if needed
4. **Message Worker** sends the response to the parent
5. **Persist Worker** saves the interaction for future reference

### Real-World Flow Example

**User:** "My 3-year-old has a fever of 102°F. What should I do?"

**Worker Coordination:**

```
Search Worker → Finds fever guidelines for children
AI Worker → Analyzes the situation and generates caring advice
Selector Worker → Decides this needs immediate attention
Message Worker → Sends urgent response with clear instructions
Persist Worker → Records the interaction for follow-up
```

**Result:** Parent gets immediate, accurate, and caring guidance about their child's fever.

## Choosing the Right Workers

### Start Simple

**Begin with these essential workers:**
