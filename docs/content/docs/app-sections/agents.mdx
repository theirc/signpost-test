Signpost AI offers multiple ways to create agents, from fully manual construction to AI-powered auto-generation.

### Step 1: Choose Creation Method

![Agents Creation Interface](/images/screenshots/agents/agents-creation.png)
*Agents Creation Interface - Initial setup screen for new agents*

1. **Click "Create New Agent"** from the main dashboard
2. **Select Creation Method**:

#### Option A: Auto-Generate (Recommended for Beginners)
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Describe your agent in natural language and let AI build the complete flow
- **Intelligent Templates**: Automatically selects appropriate workers and connections
- **Best for**: Quick prototyping, learning the platform, or when you're not sure how to structure your agent

#### Option B: From Scratch
- **Manual Construction**: Build your agent step-by-step using the flow designer
- **Full Control**: Complete customization of every component and connection
- **Best for**: Complex custom logic, specific requirements, or experienced users

#### Option C: From Template
- **Pre-built Configurations**: Start with proven agent templates
- **Industry-Specific**: Templates for common use cases like sentiment analysis, content generation
- **Best for**: Standard workflows with minor customizations needed

### Step 2A: Auto-Generation Workflow

The auto-generation feature uses advanced AI to create complete agent flows based on your description.

#### How Auto-Generation Works

1. **Describe Your Agent**: Enter a natural language description of what you want your agent to do
   ```
   Example: "Create an agent that analyzes customer feedback and categorizes sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral"
   ```

2. **AI Analysis**: The system analyzes your description and:
   - Identifies the required worker types
   - Generates appropriate prompts and configurations
   - Creates logical connections between components
   - Positions workers optimally on the canvas

3. **Review & Customize**: The generated template is fully editable:
   - Modify worker configurations
   - Adjust prompts and instructions
   - Change connections and flow logic
   - Add or remove workers as needed

#### Specialized Auto-Generated Templates

The system recognizes common patterns and creates optimized templates:

**Sentiment Analysis Agents**
- Input → Sentiment Analyzer (AI) → Structured Output → Response
- Pre-configured with sentiment analysis prompts
- JSON-formatted output with confidence scores

**Research Paper Summarizers**
- Input → Document Processor → Research Analyzer (AI) → Summary Formatter → Response
- Specialized prompts for academic content
- Structured output with key findings, methodology, conclusions

**Content Generators**
- Requirements Input → Creative AI → Content Formatter → Response
- High creativity settings (temperature 0.8)
- Prompts optimized for engaging content creation

**API Integration Agents**
- Input → External API Call → Response Processor (AI) → Formatted Output
- Pre-configured error handling
- Response analysis and data extraction

**Search & Analysis Agents**
- Query Input → Knowledge Search → Result Analyzer (AI) → Insights Output
- Connected to your knowledge collections
- Intelligent result summarization

#### Auto-Generation Best Practices

**Writing Effective Descriptions:**
- Be specific about inputs and outputs
- Mention the type of processing needed
- Include any special requirements or constraints
- Example: "Translate customer emails from multiple languages to English, detect urgent issues, and route to appropriate departments"

**Common Description Patterns:**
- **Analysis**: "Analyze [input type] and identify [patterns/insights]"
- **Generation**: "Generate [content type] based on [requirements]"
- **Processing**: "Process [data type] and extract [specific information]"
- **Integration**: "Connect to [external service] and [action]"

### Step 2B: Manual Agent Setup

When building from scratch, start with basic agent details:

1. **Enter Agent Details**:
   - **Agent Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Support Bot")
   - **Description**: Explain what the agent does
   - **Category**: Select appropriate category for organization
2. **Configure Initial Settings**:
   - **Agent Type**: Conversational, Data Processing, or API
   - **Default Model**: Choose your preferred AI model
   - **Team Access**: Set team-level permissions

### Step 3: Flow Designer - Adding Workers

## 4. Best Practices and Advanced Techniques

### Design Principles

#### Agent Architecture Best Practices

**Start Simple, Scale Smart:**
- Begin with linear flows: Input → Process → Output
- Add complexity gradually as requirements become clear
- Use auto-generation for initial structure, then refine manually
- Document decision points and branching logic clearly

**Modular Design Patterns:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each worker should have one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep data processing separate from business logic
- **Reusable Components**: Design workers that can be used in multiple contexts
- **Error Boundaries**: Isolate potential failure points

**Flow Design Strategies:**
```
Recommended Flow Patterns:

1. Simple Linear Flow:
   Input → AI Processing → Response

2. Validation Flow:
   Input → Validator → Processing → Error Handler → Response

3. Multi-Step Analysis:
   Input → Preprocessor → Analyzer → Aggregator → Response

4. API Integration Flow:
   Input → Data Formatter → API Call → Result Processor → Response

5. Knowledge-Augmented Flow:
   Input → Search → Context Merger → AI + Context → Response
```

#### Prompt Engineering Excellence

**System Prompt Best Practices:**
- Be specific about the agent's role and capabilities
- Include examples of desired input/output formats
- Set clear boundaries and limitations
- Use consistent terminology throughout

**Dynamic Prompt Construction:**
```
Example System Prompt Structure:

You are a [ROLE] specialized in [DOMAIN].

Your capabilities include:
- [CAPABILITY 1]
- [CAPABILITY 2]
- [CAPABILITY 3]

Input format: [DESCRIBE EXPECTED INPUT]
Output format: [DESCRIBE REQUIRED OUTPUT]

Guidelines:
- [GUIDELINE 1]
- [GUIDELINE 2]
- [CONSTRAINT 1]

Examples:
Input: [EXAMPLE INPUT]
Output: [EXAMPLE OUTPUT]
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Latency Reduction Strategies

**Component Optimization:**
- **Minimize Worker Count**: Consolidate simple operations into single workers
- **Parallel Execution**: Design independent operations to run simultaneously

- **Fast Models**: Use lighter models (GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku) for simple tasks
- **Powerful Models**: Reserve GPT-4, Claude Sonnet for complex reasoning
- **Specialized Models**: Use domain-specific models when available
- **Cost vs. Speed**: Balance model capability with response time requirements

#### Resource Management

**Memory Optimization:**
- Limit context window size for long conversations
- Implement conversation summarization for history management

    "allowedRoles": ["admin", "developer"],
    "rateLimiting": {
      "requestsPerMinute": 60,
      "requestsPerHour": 1000
    },
    "contentFiltering": {
      "enableProfanityFilter": true,
