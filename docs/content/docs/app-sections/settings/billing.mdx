This sub-section allows users to manage their billing details, monitor their usage, and handle their subscriptions. It fits within the larger Settings section as a financial management tool, providing users with the ability to control their spending and usage within the application.

Users would typically use this feature to:

- Update their payment methods
- Review their subscription status
- Monitor their usage to avoid overages
- View their billing history

## Key Features

This feature allows users to manage their subscription status. Users can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their subscriptions. To access this feature, navigate to the 'Subscription' tab within the Billing & Usage sub-section.

### Usage Tracking

Usage tracking provides users with a detailed overview of their usage statistics. This feature helps users understand their consumption patterns and avoid overages. It can be accessed from the 'Usage' tab.

### Payment Methods

Users can add, remove, or update their payment methods using this feature. It is located in the 'Payment Methods' tab.

### Billing History

The billing history feature provides a chronological record of all past payments. Users can access this feature from the 'Billing History' tab.

## User Interface

The Billing & Usage sub-section has a clean, user-friendly design. The main navigation bar at the top allows users to switch between the 'Subscription', 'Usage', 'Payment Methods', and 'Billing History' tabs.
