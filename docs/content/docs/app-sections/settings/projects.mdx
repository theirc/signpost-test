## Overview

The Project Management sub-section is a critical part of the Settings section in Signpost AI. It allows users to create, configure, control access, and share projects. This feature is essential for users who need to manage multiple projects and control their settings in a centralized location. Users would use this feature to streamline their project management process, ensuring that all projects are organized, accessible, and shared appropriately.

## Key Features

- **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects by clicking on the 'New Project' button. A form will appear where users can enter the project's details.

- **Project Configuration**: Each project can be configured according to the user's needs. This includes setting the project's name, description, and other related settings.

- **Access Control**: Users can control who has access to each project. They can add or remove team members and set their access levels.

- **Project Sharing**: Projects can be shared with others by generating a shareable link. This link can be sent to team members or stakeholders who need access to the project.

## User Interface

The Project Management sub-section has a clean and intuitive design. The main page displays a list of all projects, with options to create a new project or edit existing ones. Each project has its own page, where users can configure the project's settings, control access, and share the project.

## How to Use

1. **Creating a New Project**: Click on the 'New Project' button, fill in the project details in the form that appears, and click 'Create'.

2. **Configuring a Project**: Click on a project from the project list to open its page. Here, you can edit the project's details and settings.

3. **Controlling Access**: In a project's page, go to the 'Access Control' section. Here, you can add or remove team members and set their access levels.

4. **Sharing a Project**: In a project's page, click on the 'Share' button to generate a shareable link. This link can be copied and sent to others.

## Configuration & Settings

Users can customize each project's settings according to their needs. This includes setting the project's name, description, and other related settings. Advanced configuration options are also available for more complex project setups.

## Integration

The Project Management sub-section is integrated with other parts of Signpost AI. Changes made to a project's settings will reflect across the system. It is also connected to the User Management section, where user access levels are managed.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include not being able to create a new project or edit a project's settings. These can often be resolved by checking the user's access level and ensuring they have the necessary permissions. If an error message appears, refer to the message's description for guidance on how to resolve the issue. For performance optimization, it is recommended to regularly review and update project settings as necessary.
