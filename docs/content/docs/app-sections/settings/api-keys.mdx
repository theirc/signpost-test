## Overview

The API Key Management sub-section is a crucial part of the Settings section in Signpost AI. It allows users to generate and manage API keys, set up integrations, and adjust security settings. This feature is typically used by developers and system administrators who need to connect Signpost AI to other systems or services. 

## Key Features

### Key Generation

Users can generate new API keys from this section. To do this, navigate to the 'Generate New Key' button and click it. A new API key will be generated and displayed for the user.

### Key Management

This feature allows users to view, delete, and regenerate existing API keys. Users can manage their keys by clicking on the 'Manage Keys' button.

### Integration Setup

Users can set up integrations with other systems or services using the API keys generated. To set up an integration, users need to provide the API key to the system or service they want to integrate with.

### Security Settings

Users can adjust the security settings related to their API keys. This includes setting permissions for each key, such as read, write, or admin access.

## User Interface

The API Key Management sub-section has a clean and intuitive layout. The main controls are the 'Generate New Key' and 'Manage Keys' buttons. The list of existing keys is displayed in a table format, with columns for the key, permissions, and actions (delete, regenerate).

## How to Use

To generate a new key, click on the 'Generate New Key' button. A new key will be displayed, which you can copy and use as needed. To manage existing keys, click on the 'Manage Keys' button. This will display a list of all your keys, along with their permissions and actions.

## Configuration & Settings

Users can customize the permissions for each key in the 'Manage Keys' section. To do this, click on the 'Edit' button next to the key you want to modify. You can then select the desired permissions and click 'Save'.

## Integration

The API Key Management sub-section is primarily used to enable integrations with other systems or services. The API keys generated can be used to authenticate and authorize requests from these external systems.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using this sub-section, check the following:

- Ensure the API key is correctly copied and pasted into the external system.
- Check the permissions for the key. If the key does not have the necessary permissions, you may encounter authorization errors.
- If you're experiencing performance issues, consider regenerating your keys or creating new ones.
