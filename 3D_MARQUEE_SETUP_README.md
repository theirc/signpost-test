# 3D Marquee Login Page Setup

## Overview
The login page has been successfully updated to use a 3D marquee background instead of the previous gradient/image backdrop. The marquee creates an immersive 3D perspective effect with rotating and scrolling images.

## Current Implementation
- **3D Marquee Component**: Created at `src/components/ui/3d-marquee.tsx`
- **Login Page**: Updated at `src/pages/login.tsx` to use the marquee as background
- **CSS**: Added 3D transform styles in `src/index.css`

## Current Status
The login page is currently using placeholder images from Picsum Photos for testing purposes. The 3D marquee effect is fully functional with:
- 4-column grid layout with 3D perspective
- Alternating column animations (10s and 15s cycles)
- Hover effects on individual images
- Grid line overlays for visual enhancement
- Responsive scaling for different screen sizes

## To Use Your Screenshot Assets

### Option 1: Move Assets to Public Folder (Recommended)
1. Copy your screenshot files to the `public/` folder with simpler names:
   ```bash
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.31.30 PM.png" "public/screenshot1.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.31.45 PM.png" "public/screenshot2.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.32.17 PM.png" "public/screenshot3.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.32.38 PM.png" "public/screenshot4.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.32.48 PM.png" "public/screenshot5.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.33.04 PM.png" "public/screenshot6.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.33.19 PM.png" "public/screenshot7.png"
   cp "src/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.33.42 PM.png" "public/screenshot8.png"
   ```

2. Update the `screenshotAssets` array in `src/pages/login.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const screenshotAssets = [
     "/screenshot1.png",
     "/screenshot2.png",
     "/screenshot3.png",
     "/screenshot4.png",
     "/screenshot5.png",
     "/screenshot6.png",
     "/screenshot7.png",
     "/screenshot8.png",
   ]
   ```

### Option 2: Use Asset Imports
1. Import the assets directly in the login component:
   ```typescript
   import screenshot1 from "@/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.31.30 PM.png"
   import screenshot2 from "@/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 8.31.45 PM.png"
   // ... continue for all screenshots
   
   const screenshotAssets = [
     screenshot1,
     screenshot2,
     // ... continue for all screenshots
   ]
   ```

## Features of the 3D Marquee
- **3D Perspective**: 55° X-rotation and -45° Z-rotation for immersive depth
- **Smooth Animations**: Alternating column movements with different timing
- **Hover Effects**: Images lift up on hover with shadow animations
- **Grid Lines**: Decorative horizontal and vertical grid overlays
- **Responsive**: Scales from 50% (mobile) to 100% (desktop)
- **Performance**: Uses Motion library for optimized animations

## Customization Options
You can customize the marquee by modifying:
- **Animation Speed**: Change duration values in the motion.div components
- **Grid Layout**: Adjust the `chunkSize` calculation for different column counts
- **3D Rotation**: Modify the transform values in the main container
- **Image Sizing**: Adjust the `aspect-[970/700]` class for different image ratios
- **Grid Lines**: Customize colors and offsets in the GridLine components

## Dependencies
- **Motion**: Already installed in the project (`motion` package)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling and responsive design
- **React**: Core framework for the component

## Testing
The login page should now display with:
1. A dynamic 3D marquee background with scrolling images
2. A semi-transparent login form overlay with backdrop blur
3. Smooth animations and hover effects
4. Responsive behavior across different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting
- If images don't load, check the file paths and ensure assets are accessible
- If animations are choppy, ensure the Motion library is properly imported
- If the 3D effect doesn't work, verify the CSS transform-3d class is applied
- For build errors, ensure all imports are correct and dependencies are installed
